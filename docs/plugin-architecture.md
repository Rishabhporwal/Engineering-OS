# Section 4.1 — Plugin Architecture

> How the Brain Engineering OS plugin itself is built. Read this if you need to extend the plugin, debug a behaviour, or hand it off to a teammate.

---

## Architectural choice: it is a Claude Code plugin

The Brain Engineering OS is delivered as a **Claude Code plugin**, not a separate web service. Reasons:

| Option | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| **Claude Code plugin (chosen)** | Lives where work happens (the repo); shares git for sync; no extra infra; subagents + skills + commands + hooks are native primitives; works with any Claude Code workspace | Coupled to Claude Code's runtime; less flexibility for non-CLI users | **YES** |
| Standalone web service | Multi-channel access (Slack, web); central state | Needs hosting; auth/multi-tenant; sync infrastructure; UX work; out of scope for this build | NO |
| GitHub Action only | Free, runs on PRs | No interactive intake; no dev-time loop | NO (could augment plugin later) |
| Slack bot | Conversational | Needs hosting; no code context | NO |

A future companion (Slack notifier, GitHub Action) can be added later — the plugin's source of truth (`.engineering-os/`) is in git, so any companion just reads from git.

---

## Components (mapped to Claude Code primitives)

| Plugin primitive | Brain use | Lives in |
|------------------|-----------|----------|
| **Subagents** | The 10 named agents (CTO Advisor, Aryan, Vikram, Ananya, Karan, Maya, Shreya, Tanvi, Jatin, Priya) | [`agents/`](../agents/) |
| **Skills** | The 53 curated Brain skills, mirrored | [`plugin-skills/`](../plugin-skills/) |
| **Slash commands** | `/requirement`, `/status`, `/recall`, `/handoff`, `/approve`, `/reject`, `/deploy`, `/rollback`, `/skill`, `/persona` | [`commands/`](../commands/) |
| **Hooks** | Session-start memory rehydration; post-tool-use journal append; pre-handoff gate check | [`hooks/`](../hooks/) |
| **Plugin manifest** | Declares everything above | [`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`](../.claude-plugin/plugin.json) |
| **Persistent state** | Shared memory, decision log, run artifacts — git-committed | [`.engineering-os/`](../.engineering-os/) |
| **Reference docs** | Operating manual, business/technical primer, skill matrix, role empowerment, this file | [`docs/`](../docs/) |
| **Templates + schemas** | Artifact shapes (CTOA review, plan, dev report, security review, etc.) | [`templates/`](../templates/), [`schemas/`](../schemas/) |
| **Workflows** | State machine YAML, approval flow, requirement-to-release | [`workflows/`](../workflows/) |
| **System prompts** | The shared system prompt, the anti-blind-agreement prompt, the challenge framework | [`prompts/`](../prompts/) |

## Plugin manifest ([`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`](../.claude-plugin/plugin.json))

Already created. Key fields:

```json
{
  "name": "brain-engineering-os",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "components": {
    "agents": "./agents",
    "skills": "./plugin-skills",
    "commands": "./commands",
    "hooks": "./hooks/hooks.json"
  },
  "engineering-os": {
    "shared-state-dir": ".engineering-os",
    "memory-model": "git-committed append-only journals",
    "canon-roots": [
      "Requirements/BRAIN_BUSINESS.md",
      "Requirements/BRAIN_TECHNICAL.md",
      "Requirements/skills"
    ],
    "team": { ... 10 personas ... }
  }
}
```

The `engineering-os` block is a Brain-specific extension (Claude Code ignores fields it doesn't know). Future hooks read it to find the shared state dir, the canon roots, and the team naming.

---

## Subagent design (the 10 agents)

Each agent is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter, following Claude Code's subagent format:

```markdown
---
name: backend-developer
description: Vikram — Brain's Node-side backend developer. Owns api-gateway, core-service, notifications-service. Auto-load when work touches Fastify routes, tRPC procedures, gRPC servers/clients, Prisma migrations, KafkaJS, Zod schemas. PROACTIVELY use for any Stage 3 backend track.
tools: [Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob, TodoWrite]
model: sonnet
---

# Vikram — Backend Developer

[role mission + responsibilities + assigned skills + decision rights + inputs + outputs + quality checklist + escalation rules + prompt instructions + anti-blind-agreement behavior]
```

The body of each agent file embeds:
- The shared system prompt header (link to `prompts/system-prompt.md`).
- The agent's mission, authority, operating loop (from `role-empowerment-model.md`).
- The agent's owned-skill list (from `skill-mapping-matrix.md`).
- The anti-blind-agreement triggers specific to this role.
- The journal entry template.

Why this structure: Claude Code loads each subagent into its own sub-conversation with this exact body as its system prompt. Token-budget aware — each agent only loads what it needs.

---

## Skill design (53 mirrored from `Requirements/skills/`)

The 53 curated skills under `Requirements/skills/` are mirrored into `plugin-skills/` so that Claude Code can auto-load them as plugin skills.

**Mirroring options considered:**

| Option | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| **Symlinks** | Single source of truth | macOS/Linux only; portability headaches; some git clients dislike | NO |
| **File copies** | Portable; simple | Two places to update | NO |
| **Generated mirror** | Single source of truth; CI-validated | Slight build complexity | **YES** |

The mirror is created and kept in sync by a small script invoked on session start (`hooks/on-session-start.sh`) and validated by a CI check that fails if a skill exists in one place but not the other.

For now, **MVP simplification:** the mirror is the same content, refreshed manually when skills change. V2 adds the automated sync.

---

## Slash command design

Each command is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: requirement
description: Submit a new requirement to the Engineering OS pipeline (Stage 1)
args:
  - name: text
    description: The requirement text in natural language
    required: true
---

[command body: detailed instructions for how to interpret args and route to the CTO Advisor subagent]
```

When the user types `/requirement <text>`, Claude Code:
1. Reads the command body.
2. Substitutes `$ARGUMENTS` with the user's input.
3. Invokes the body as a prompt — typically delegating to the `cto-advisor` subagent.

The full list of 10 commands is in [`commands/`](../commands/) (built in Section 7).

---

## Hook design

Hooks are shell scripts (or any executable) registered in `hooks/hooks.json`. Three primary hooks in MVP:

### 1. `on-session-start.sh` (event: `SessionStart`)

Runs once when Claude Code opens. Steps:
1. Read `.engineering-os/state/active.json`.
2. Print a concise summary: "3 requirements in flight: feat-X (Stage 4 — Shreya), feat-Y (Stage 7 — awaiting Founder), feat-Z (Stage 8 — monitoring)."
3. For each agent, read the last 5 entries of its journal and stage them as context (via Claude Code's session-start hook mechanism — typically a `<system-reminder>` style injection).

This is **what makes the "agents never forget" guarantee real**.

### 2. `on-pre-handoff.sh` (event: `PreToolUse` matching a handoff signal)

Runs before a handoff is committed. Steps:
1. Parse the handoff signal (which gate is the handoff crossing).
2. Read the corresponding gate definition from [docs/quality-gates.md](quality-gates.md).
3. Verify the gate conditions are met (by checking journals / artifacts).
4. If any condition fails, **block the handoff** with a clear error pointing to the missing evidence.

### 3. `on-post-tool-use.sh` (event: `PostToolUse`)

Runs after any tool use by any agent. Steps:
1. Inspect the tool result.
2. If it's a meaningful action (Edit / Write / Bash with side effect), **auto-append a journal entry** to the active agent's journal with: timestamp, agent, action summary, files touched, command output snippet.

This makes journaling automatic — agents can't forget to journal because the hook does it.

---

## State persistence model

All state is **plain files in git**. No database. No external service. Three categories:

| Category | Format | Where | Conflict-resistance |
|----------|--------|-------|---------------------|
| **Journals** (memory) | Markdown, append-only | `.engineering-os/memory/{agents,features}/` | Append-only — merge conflicts only on simultaneous appends, easily resolved by accepting both |
| **Decision log** | JSONL, append-only, line-per-decision | `.engineering-os/decision-log/<YYYY>/<MM>/<YYYY-MM-DD>.jsonl` | Append-only — line-level merge always works |
| **State** (active requirements) | JSON | `.engineering-os/state/active.json` | Last-write-wins; agents always re-read before acting; conflicts caught and surfaced |
| **Per-run artifacts** | Markdown + JSON | `.engineering-os/runs/<ts>__<req>__<operator>/` | Per-folder timestamp + operator → zero collision possible |

Detailed mechanics in [memory-and-git-sync.md](memory-and-git-sync.md).

---

## Integration points

The plugin can integrate with external systems via opt-in env vars:

| System | Env var | What it enables |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| GitHub | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | DevOps (Jatin) opens PRs; QA (Tanvi) attaches test output as PR comments |
| Slack | `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | Stage 7 sends Founder a notification; rollback alerts; daily digest |
| ClickUp / Linear / Jira | `CLICKUP_TOKEN` / `LINEAR_API_KEY` / `JIRA_TOKEN` | Priya syncs the plan to tasks (see [`task-tracker-integration`](../plugin-skills/task-tracker-integration/SKILL.md)) |
| Anthropic API | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | (Already required by Claude Code; agents inherit) |
| AWS CDK | `AWS_PROFILE` | Jatin runs `cdk diff` / `cdk deploy` (Stage 8) |
| Sentry | `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` | Release tagging |

If a token is missing, the corresponding workflow gracefully degrades: actions are logged to `.engineering-os/memory/tasks-pending.log` and the pipeline continues. (Pattern from [`task-tracker-integration`](../plugin-skills/task-tracker-integration/SKILL.md).)

---

## Authentication & authorization (within the plugin)

The plugin runs in the local user's Claude Code session — no inbound auth surface to defend. Authorization concerns:

- **Founder gate (Stage 7):** Enforced by the `approve` / `reject` slash commands recording the actor (current local OS user). For stronger guarantees in V2, the gate could require a signed commit.
- **External integrations:** Tokens are read from env vars; never written to disk.
- **Secrets in memory:** Journals must not record secrets. The journaling hook redacts known token patterns (`sk-`, `xoxb-`, etc.) before writing.

---

## Event model (within the plugin)

The plugin treats agent handoffs as events. Event types:

| Event | Emitted by | Consumed by |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| `requirement.submitted` | `/requirement` command | CTOA |
| `intake.completed` | CTOA Stage 1 | Aryan |
| `intake.challenged` | CTOA Stage 1 | Founder (notification) |
| `plan.completed` | Aryan Stage 2 | Vikram / Ananya / Karan / Maya (whoever tagged) |
| `dev.ready` | Each dev when in-lane DoD green | (counter — when all green, → Shreya) |
| `security.passed` | Shreya | Tanvi |
| `security.failed` | Shreya | Responsible dev |
| `qa.passed` | Tanvi | CTOA |
| `qa.failed` | Tanvi | Responsible dev |
| `final-review.passed` | CTOA | Founder (Stage 7 notification) |
| `founder.approved` | Founder | Jatin |
| `founder.rejected` | Founder | CTOA (re-route) |
| `deploy.staging-passed` | Jatin | (gate to prod) |
| `deploy.prod-passed` | Jatin | (48h monitor begins) |
| `monitor.clean` | Jatin (after 48h) | (status → `shipped`) |
| `monitor.alarm` | Auto | Jatin + Founder |
| `rollback.triggered` | Auto | Jatin + Shreya + Tanvi (re-enter Stage 4) |

Events are realized as: an entry in the decision log + a status update in `state/active.json` + (optionally) a Slack notification.

---

## Error handling

| Error class | Plugin behaviour |
|-------------|------------------|
| Agent runs out of context | Falls back to "read journal first, then act" pattern; surfaces "I lost context — re-read journal" to user |
| Gate check fails (hook blocks handoff) | Hook returns non-zero; surfaces missing-evidence list to user; pipeline pauses, not crashes |
| External token missing | Logs to `tasks-pending.log`; pipeline continues; notifies Founder at next status check |
| Git merge conflict on a journal | Append-only conflicts are auto-resolved by `git merge -X ours` for whitespace; substantive conflicts surface to user with reconciliation steps |
| State JSON corrupted | Plugin refuses to start; surfaces backup recovery from `.engineering-os/state/active.json.bak.<ts>` (created on each write) |
| Skill missing | Falls back to a `Read` of the original `Requirements/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` if mirror has drifted; warns user to re-sync |

---

## Audit logging

Every meaningful action produces **two** audit trails:

1. **Decision log** (`.engineering-os/decision-log/*.jsonl`) — structured, line-per-event, immutable. Searchable by `req_id`, `actor`, `type`.
2. **Per-agent + per-feature journals** (`.engineering-os/memory/`) — narrative, human-readable, append-only.

A weekly digest job (V2, `/digest` command) aggregates these into a readable Friday summary: features shipped, gates hit, bounces, escalations, who did what.

---

## Security model (of the plugin itself)

- **No secrets in committed files.** Tokens read from env vars only. Pre-commit hook (V2) scans for accidental commits of secret-looking strings.
- **Hooks are shell scripts** — readable, auditable. No binary plugins.
- **All state in plain files** — `cat` any state file to inspect.
- **No outbound network unless explicitly integrated** (GitHub, Slack, task tracker). Default plugin run is fully local + git.
- **Founder gate is enforced** by the slash command requiring explicit `/approve` invocation; subagents cannot self-approve.

---

## Deployment of the plugin

For Brain's own team, the plugin is checked into the same repo as the project. Teammates clone, open in Claude Code, work. No separate install.

For other Brain-style teams (future), the plugin can be packaged as a standalone Claude Code plugin per the [Claude Code plugin distribution model](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins) — published to a plugin marketplace, installed via `/plugin install`. The plugin's `.engineering-os/` is then created in the consumer repo.

---

## Why this architecture wins for Brain

- **No infra to maintain.** The plugin is the team; the repo is the database; git is the sync.
- **Multi-operator from day one.** Anyone with repo access has the same view of the team's state.
- **Audit by default.** Every decision is in git history forever.
- **Reversible.** A bad plugin update is `git revert`; bad agent behavior is `git revert` + journal note.
- **Aligned with Brain's principles.** Append-only journals = "Memory is the moat." Single-Primitive in plugin design (one Audience Builder analogue per concern).
